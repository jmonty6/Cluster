# Cluster

Cluster is an automotive diagnostics application currently in development in my spare time. It will connect via Bluetooth to a 
standard ELM327 OBDII adapter to perform live monitoring and/or datalogging on any available outputs from the car's computer, in addition
to retreiving and displaying any stored MIL codes.
