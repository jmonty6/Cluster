# Cluster

Cluster is an automotive diagnostics application meant to help me learn how to make android applications. It doesn't do much at the moment, but the plan is for it to connect via Bluetooth to a standard ELM327 OBDII adapter to perform live monitoring and/or datalogging on any available outputs from the car's computer, in addition to retreiving and displaying any stored MIL codes.
